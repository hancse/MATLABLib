% FIG - Create a figure window and handle it with its name.%% FIG handles figures with names instead of numbers as FIGURE does. This is% useful when you have lot of different plots that different MATLAB scripts% create.%% FIG figname   OR    FIG('figname') creates a new figure window with the name% 'figname'. If the figure with the name 'figname' already exist that will be% reused and activated as current window. FIG returns the figure hander number% for the figure and it is a non integer number to not be mixed and reused by% calls to FIGURE. With fig you can skip use of figure handler variables and% and replace input of handlers to function by FIG('figname') as in following% example.%% Example:%%    fig ModelA%    plot([1 3 3]);%    fig ModelB%    plot([1 2 3]);%    set(fig('ModelA'),'pointer','cross'); %    set(fig('ModelB'),'pointer','left');%% In this example the figure windows 'ModelA' and 'ModelB' will be reused each% time you run the script.%% Se also: FIGURE%%%   Copyright (C) Peter Rydesäter 2001, Mitthögskolan, SWEDEN%%   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or%   modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License%   as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2%   of the License, or (at your option) any later version.%%   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,%   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of%   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
